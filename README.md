### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

In this project particularly I had to take all the labs to really understand what was going on; I took every lab maybe twice to really understand each step. 

For me, the most challenging part of the project (labs) was to connect the frontend with the backend 

* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.

I would have improved the way I personalize the UI, because I think I made the UI too similar to the example shown in the course. 
Also, I would have implemented more stretch features, such as pin cards and comments

* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

I think it all went as planned
